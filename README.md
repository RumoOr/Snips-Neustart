# Snips-Neustart
A german restart app for Snips.ai

## Installation

**Important:** The following instructions assume that [Snips](https://snips.gitbook.io/documentation/snips-basics) is
already configured and running on your device. 
[SAM](https://snips.gitbook.io/getting-started/installation) should
also already be set up and connected to your device and your account.

1. In the German [app store](https://console.snips.ai/) add the
[app](https://console.snips.ai/app-editor/bundle_AdmAbpqQ2nE7) `Neustart` to your *German* assistant.

2. If you already have the same assistant on your platform, update it with:
      ```bash
      sam update-assistant
      ```
      
   Otherwise install the assistant on your platform with the following command:
      ```bash
      sam install assistant
      ```
	
## Usage

With this app you can ask Snips to reboot your system.
